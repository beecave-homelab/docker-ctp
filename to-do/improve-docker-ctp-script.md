# To-Do: Improve Docker CTP Script

This plan outlines the steps to implement enhancements to the `docker-ctp.sh` script for better security, usability, and functionality.

## Tasks

- [x] **Analysis Phase:**
  - [x] Research and evaluate tools, patterns, or libraries if needed
    - Path: [docker-ctp.sh]
    - Action: Analyze existing script for security vulnerabilities, usability issues, and feature gaps.
    - Analysis Results:
      - **CRITICAL BUGS FOUND:**
        - **Variable reference bug in `set_default_tag()` function (lines 26, 28):**
          - Uses `DOCKERHUB_DEFAULT_TAG` instead of `DEFAULT_DOCKERHUB_TAG`
          - Uses `GITHUB_DEFAULT_TAG` instead of `DEFAULT_GITHUB_TAG`
          - Impact: Function will always use fallback values, ignoring .env configuration
        - **Unbound variable error (line 159):** Script fails with `DOCKER_USERNAME: unbound variable`
          - Caused by `set -u` and undefined variables in help function
          - Impact: Script cannot run, even with --help flag
        - **.env file loading only checks one location, not current directory as documented:**
          - Only checks `$HOME/.config/docker-ctp/.env`
          - Comment says "current directory or home directory" but doesn't check current dir
          - Impact: Configuration not loaded from project directory
        - **Insecure token handling via interactive prompts:**
          - Uses `read -s PAT` without environment variable fallback
          - Not automation-friendly, blocks CI/CD usage
          - Potential exposure in process lists
      - **SECURITY ISSUES:**
        - No input validation for registry selection, usernames, or paths
        - Tokens could be exposed in process lists
        - No sanitization of user inputs
        - Command injection possible through unvalidated parameters
      - **CONFIGURATION ISSUES:**
        - Limited .env file location support (only one hard-coded path)
        - No configuration priority order implementation
        - Hard-coded registry URLs (docker.io, ghcr.io)
        - Variable initialization happens after usage in some cases
      - **USABILITY ISSUES:**
        - No dry run capability for testing
        - Basic error handling with unclear messages
        - No dependency checking (assumes Docker is available)
        - No progress indicators for long operations (builds, pushes)
        - Missing --version flag
        - Help system breaks due to unbound variables
      - **MISSING FEATURES:**
        - No multi-architecture build support (Docker buildx)
        - No cleanup function for interrupted builds
        - No logging levels (verbose/quiet modes)
        - No build context validation (Dockerfile exists, .dockerignore)
        - No support for custom registry URLs
      - **CODE QUALITY ISSUES:**
        - Inconsistent variable naming patterns
        - Functions not properly isolated
        - Error handling scattered throughout script
        - No input parameter bounds checking
    - Accept Criteria: ✅ Clear understanding of current script limitations and potential improvements.

      - Status: ✅ Completed - Updated load_env_file() function to check 5 standard locations in priority order: current directory, project config, user config, user home, and system config. Provides clear feedback about which file is loaded or lists all checked locations if none found.

    **Phase 1 Summary:** All critical bugs that prevented script execution and posed security risks have been resolved. The script now runs reliably, handles authentication securely, validates all inputs, and supports flexible configuration management.

  - [x] **Phase 2: Core Functionality (Medium Priority) - ✅ COMPLETED**
    - [x] Implement dry run mode
      - Path: [docker-ctp.sh]
      - Action: Add `--dry-run` flag to simulate operations without execution
      - Status: ✅ Completed - Added DRY_RUN variable and dry run logic throughout all main functions (login, build, tag, push). Includes log_dry_run() function for clear dry run feedback.
    - [x] Enhanced error handling and logging
      - Path: [docker-ctp.sh]
      - Action: Add logging levels (--verbose, --quiet), better error messages with context
      - Status: ✅ Completed - Implemented comprehensive logging system with log_info(), log_verbose(), log_success(), log_warning(), log_error() functions. Added --verbose and --quiet flags with LOG_LEVEL control.
    - [x] Add dependency checking
      - Path: [docker-ctp.sh]
      - Action: Verify Docker is installed and accessible, check for required tools
      - Status: ✅ Completed - Added check_dependencies() function that validates Docker installation, daemon status, and essential system tools (realpath, basename, grep). Provides clear error messages for missing dependencies.

  - [ ] **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Lower Priority)**
    - [x] Smart image rebuild optimization
      - Path: [docker-ctp.sh]
      - Action: Check if image with target name:tag already exists before rebuilding
      - Implementation Details:
        - Add `--force-rebuild` flag to force rebuild even if image exists
        - Modify build_docker_image() function to check existing images first
        - Use `docker image inspect <image>:<tag>` to check for existing images
        - If image exists and --force-rebuild not set: skip build, proceed to tag/push
        - If image doesn't exist or --force-rebuild is set: proceed with normal build
        - Add verbose logging to show when skipping rebuild vs. building
        - Respect dry-run mode for image existence checks
      - Benefits:
        - Significantly faster build times during development
        - Reduced resource usage (CPU, disk, network)
        - Better CI/CD pipeline efficiency
        - Maintains flexibility with force rebuild option
      - Status: ✅ Completed - Added FORCE_REBUILD variable, --force-rebuild flag parsing, check_image_exists() function, smart rebuild logic in build_docker_image(), updated help text with examples, and comprehensive verbose logging. The feature intelligently skips rebuilds when images already exist while providing --force-rebuild option for mandatory rebuilds.
    - [ ] Multi-architecture support
      - Path: [docker-ctp.sh]
      - Action: Support building for multiple platforms using Docker buildx
      - Status: Pending
    - [x] Configuration file generation
      - Path: [docker-ctp.sh]
      - Action: Generate default .env files and config templates
      - Implementation Details:
        - Add `--generate-config` flag to generate default configuration files
        - Create .env files in multiple locations (project and config directory)
        - Generate comprehensive .dockerignore template
        - Provide clear usage instructions and next steps
        - Support dry-run mode for config generation
        - Avoid overwriting existing configuration files
      - Status: ✅ Completed - Added generate_config_files() function with --generate-config flag, comprehensive .env template generation with all available options, .dockerignore template creation, multi-location support, and detailed usage instructions.
    - [x] Version flag and improved help system
      - Path: [docker-ctp.sh]
      - Action: Add --version flag, enhance help with examples and better formatting
      - Status: ✅ Completed - Version flag fully implemented with proper version info, author, and license display. Help system enhanced with color formatting, comprehensive examples, and dynamic variable display.
    - [x] Build context validation
      - Path: [docker-ctp.sh]
      - Action: Validate Dockerfile exists, check .dockerignore, optimize build context
      - Implementation Details:
        - Add validation for .dockerignore file presence and syntax
        - Warn about potentially large build contexts
        - Check for common build context optimization opportunities
        - Provide suggestions for improving build performance
      - Status: ✅ Completed - Added comprehensive validate_build_context() function with .dockerignore syntax validation, large file detection (>50MB), common optimization pattern checking, and actionable improvement suggestions. Integrated into main validation flow.

    **Phase 3 Summary:** Advanced features implementation completed. The script now includes smart rebuild optimization for faster development cycles, comprehensive configuration file generation, enhanced help and version systems, and intelligent build context validation with optimization suggestions.

  - [ ] **Phase 4: Code Organization**
    - [x] Centralize variable management
      - Path: [docker-ctp.sh]
      - Action: Implement configuration priority order (CLI > ENV > .env > defaults)
      - Implementation Details:
        - Ensured `IMAGE_NAME` correctly respects priority (CLI > ENV/.env > default `basename "$PWD"`) by removing its reset in `set_dynamic_repos`.
        - Ensured `USERNAME` is determined based on the final `REGISTRY` value if not set by `-u` CLI option. This uses specific `DOCKER_USERNAME` or `GITHUB_USERNAME` which follow ENV/.env > default.
        - Removed premature generic `USERNAME` initialization from `init_variables`.
        - Verified that other variables like `TAG`, `DOCKERFILE_DIR`, `REGISTRY`, and boolean flags (`USE_CACHE`, `FORCE_REBUILD` etc.) already follow the CLI > ENV/.env > default priority through the existing structure of `init_variables` and `parse_arguments`.
      - Status: ✅ Completed - Variable initialization and resolution logic refined to consistently apply the desired priority. `IMAGE_NAME` and `USERNAME` handling are now robust.
    - [x] Modularize functions
      - Path: [docker-ctp.sh]
      - Action: Better separation of concerns, reusable function components
      - Implementation Details:
        - The script already exhibits a good level of modularity with functions dedicated to specific tasks (logging, parsing, core operations, validation, etc.).
        - Recent changes to variable management have further clarified the logic flow and separation of configuration concerns.
        - No major refactoring for modularity is deemed essential at this stage, as functions are generally cohesive and reusable within the script's context.
      - Status: ✅ Completed - Existing modular structure reviewed and considered sufficient. Variable management clarification enhances overall organization.

    **Phase 4 Summary:** Code organization improvements are complete. Variable management now strictly follows the priority order of CLI > ENV > .env > defaults, with specific fixes for `IMAGE_NAME` and `USERNAME` resolution. The script's modular function structure has been reviewed and deemed effective.

- [ ] **Testing Phase:**
  - [x] Unit or integration tests
    - Path: [tests/test_docker_ctp.sh]
    - Action: Create test suite using Bash Automated Testing System (bats) to validate script functionality.
    - Status: ✅ Initial test suite created with setup, teardown, and basic tests for help, version, unknown options, dry run, and config generation. Proceeding with more tests despite a persistent linter warning on the BATS file that needs further investigation.
    - Test Coverage:
      - [x] Basic script invocation (help, version, errors)
      - [x] Dry run mode validation (basic)
      - [x] Configuration file generation (--generate-config)
      - [ ] Variable reference fixes (covered by priority tests)
      - [ ] Security enhancements (input validation tests needed)
      - [ ] Error handling scenarios (specific error tests needed)
      - [ ] Multi-registry support (specific tests for docker/github)
      - [ ] Configuration loading priority (in progress)
      - [ ] Enhanced logging system (quiet/verbose modes)
      - [ ] Dependency checking
      - [ ] Progress indicators (visual, harder to test)
      - [ ] Cleanup functionality (requires Docker interaction)
      - [ ] Smart image rebuild (requires Docker interaction)
      - [ ] Build context validation (output checks)
    - Accept Criteria: All critical functions pass tests under various scenarios.

- [ ] **Documentation Phase:**
  - [ ] Update `README.md` file
    - Path: [README.md]
    - Action: Update documentation to reflect new features, security improvements, and usage examples. Consider generating man pages.
    - Accept Criteria: Documentation is up-to-date and explains the new features clearly.
